This can be extremely useful when non-technical staff who\ninteract with the hubot need to alert Operations personnel and your monitoring\nsystem is not catching the issue.\n\nTo configure this, you need a \"service key\" from PagerDuty. To create this:\n\n* Click on the \"Services\" tab in the PagerDuty UI at the top.\n* Click on \"Add a New Service\"\n* Name your service and select the escalation policy these pages will route to.\n* Under \"Service Type\", select \"Generic API Service\".\n* Submit the Form.\n\nOn the page that appears next you will see a listing for a \"service key\", which\nis a big string of numbers. That's the value you need to put in your\n`pagerdutyrc` under `urgent_page_service_key`.\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\nHotel Tonight (www.hoteltonight.com) whipped this up.
