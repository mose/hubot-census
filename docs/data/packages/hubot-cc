hubot-cc\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-cc.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-cc)\n[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-cc/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/ClaudeBot/hubot-cc#info=devDependencies)\n\n__This script relies on a new Hubot [v2.16.0](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v2160) feature known as ['receive middleware'](https://github.com/github/hubot/pull/1019). It WILL NOT work on older versions of Hubot.__\n\nA Hubot script for defining aliases to easily @mention groups of people in a room or a global context.\n\nSee [`src/cc.coffee`](src/cc.coffee) for full documentation.\n\n\n## Installation via NPM\n\n1. Install the **hubot-cc** module as a Hubot dependency by running:\n\n    ```\n    npm install --save hubot-cc\n    ```\n\n2. Enable the module by adding the **hubot-cc** entry to your `external-scripts.json` file:\n\n    ```json\n    [\n        \"hubot-cc\"\n    ]\n    ```\n\n3. Run your bot and see below for available config / commands\n\n\n## Commands\n\nCommand | Listener ID | Description\n--- | --- | ---\nhubot cc new-channel `alias` `users...` | `cc.new.channel` | Creates a new @`alias` to @mention all `users...` (space separated) in the context of the current room / channel\nhubot cc new-global `alias` `users...` | `cc.new.global` | Creates a new @`alias` to @mention all `users...` (space separated) in any context\ncc remove `alias` | `cc.remove` | Removes @`alias` from the current, and the global context\ncc list | `cc.list` | Returns all defined aliases\n\n### Contexts\n\nThe difference between `new-channel`, and `new-global` is that aliases created using the former (`new-channel`) can only be triggered in the room / channel (context) that it was created in. Aliases created using the latter (`new-global`) however, can be triggered in any context as long as the bot is present in it.\n\nIf there is an alias defined with the same name in a local (room / channel), and a global context, both of them _may be triggered_ at the same time.\n\n\n## Sample Interaction\n\n```\nuser1>> hubot cc new-global admins user1 user2 user3\nhubot>> user1: The @admins alias has now been added / updated. Try it out!\nuser1>> Hello @admins!\nhubot>> cc: @user1 @user2 @user3\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"mrsaints","email":"ian@fyianlai.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-05-29T21:19:45.344Z","created":"2016-03-06T18:13:00.392Z","0.0.1":"2016-03-06T18:13:00.392Z","0.0.2":"2016-03-06T19:18:57.049Z","0.0.3":"2016-03-06T20:40:43.849Z","0.0.4":"2016-03-06T21:06:21.386Z","0.0.5":"2016-05-29T21:19:45.344Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-cc#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","aliases","mentions","groups","rooms","channels"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-cc.git"},"author":{"name":"Ian Lai","email":"os@fyianlai.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-cc/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
