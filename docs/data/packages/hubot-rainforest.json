Hubot-Rainforest\n\n[Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/) script to interface with [Rainforest QA](https://www.rainforestqa.com/).\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd a dependency to your Hubot instance using NPM:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install --save hubot-rainforest\n```\n\nThen add this script to the `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\"hubot-rainforest\"]\n```\n\nYou'll need to get your Rainforest token from your [Rainforest settings page](https://app.rainforestqa.com/settings/account), and stick it in an environment variable in your deployment.\nFor heroku, that looks like this:\n\n```bash\n$ heroku config:set HUBOT_RAINFOREST_TOKEN <token>\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n```\n> hubot rf subscribe - Subscribe the current channel to test-run status updates\n> hubot rf unsubscribe - Remove this room from the subscription list\n> hubot rf status - Query the last 5 test runs\n> hubot rf subscriptions - List the rooms that are subscribed to status updates\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"benstraub","email":"ben@straub.cc"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-01-20T15:23:34.953Z","created":"2014-08-26T03:02:18.455Z","0.1.0":"2014-08-26T03:02:18.455Z","0.1.1":"2014-08-26T03:07:01.348Z","0.1.2":"2014-08-26T14:15:00.628Z","0.1.3":"2014-09-15T16:47:54.471Z","0.2.0":"2014-09-23T18:50:58.112Z","0.2.1":"2015-04-17T14:19:18.277Z","0.2.2":"2015-06-30T14:42:06.575Z","0.2.3":"2016-01-20T15:23:34.953Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/gridium/hubot-rainforest","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","rainforest"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/gridium/hubot-rainforest.git"},"author":{"name":"Ben
