You need to create a Skype account for your bot, and log into it\non a Skype client running on the same machine as hubot. When you first\nlaunch hubot with the Skype adapter, Skype will prompt you to allow for\nAPI permission. You must allow this before the bot will work.\n\n## OS Specific notes\n\n### OSX\n\nThe current version of Skype4Py doesn't play nicely with the 64 bit version \nof python on OSX and will immediately cause a segmentation fault. You may \nneed to force python to run in 32 bit mode by setting the environment variable \n`VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT` to `true`\n\nEx:\n\n```bash\nexport VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes\n./hubot -a skype\n```\n\n### Linux\nIf you would like to use a different transport type than the default (`x11`) \nyou may set the `HUBOT_SKYPE_TRANSPORT` evnirontment variable.Currently \nsupported values are `x11` amd `dbus`.
