It leverages on the platform's Send / Receive API. It is tested, and ready-to-use. This repository is NOT affiliated with Facebook.**\n\nThis adapter currently supports:\n\n- [x] Token validation\n- [x] Basic sending / receiving\n- [x] Resolving user IDs to their full names\n- [x] Tracking user ID, message ID, recipient ID (page)\n- [x] Auto-truncating long messages\n\n### 320 characters limit\n\nAt the time of writing, the [Send API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference) only allows up to 320 characters. We strongly recommend using a plugin like [`hubot-longtext`](https://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-longtext) to gracefully handle long messages.\n\n\nSee [`src/messenger.coffee`](src/messenger.coffee) for full documentation.\n\n\n## Installation via NPM\n\n```\nnpm install --save hubot-messenger-bot\n```\n\nNow, run Hubot with the `messenger-bot` adapter:\n\n```\n./bin/hubot -a messenger-bot\n```\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nVariable | Default | Description\n--- | --- | ---\n`MESSENGER_VERIFY_TOKEN` | N/A | Your bot's verification token. You can obtain one when you [create a web hook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart) to receive events for a specific page.\n`MESSENGER_ACCESS_TOKEN` | N/A | Your page access token (it is based on an app, page, and user). You can find it in the _\"Token Generation\"_ section of your [app dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).\n\nRefer to [\"Getting Started - Messenger Platform\"](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart), and [\"Complete Guide - Messenger Platform\"](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/implementation) for more information.\n","versions":{"1.0.1":{"name":"hubot-messenger-bot","description":"A Hubot adapter for Facebook Messenger Platform (Bots) with zero external dependencies.","version":"1.0.1","author":{"name":"Ian Lai","email":"os@fyianlai.com"},"license":"MIT","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","adapter","facebook","platform","messenger","bot"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-messenger-bot.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-messenger-bot/issues"},"dependencies":{},"peerDependencies":{},"main":"./src/messenger.coffee","scripts":{"test":"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"},"gitHead":"fba823fb229dd6aecf734e76377933a6594aebb2","homepage":"https://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-messenger-bot#readme","_id":"hubot-messenger-bot@1.0.1","_shasum":"278115ce56cdc7d10677edabcca818cfe8669b31","_from":".","_npmVersion":"3.4.1","_nodeVersion":"5.0.0","_npmUser":{"name":"mrsaints","email":"ian@fyianlai.com"},"dist":{"shasum":"278115ce56cdc7d10677edabcca818cfe8669b31","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hubot-messenger-bot/-/hubot-messenger-bot-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mrsaints","email":"ian@fyianlai.com"}],"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/hubot-messenger-bot-1.0.1.tgz_1460498960617_0.4408797877840698"}}},"homepage":"https://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-messenger-bot#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","adapter","facebook","platform","messenger","bot"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-messenger-bot.git"},"author":{"name":"Ian Lai","email":"os@fyianlai.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ClaudeBot/hubot-messenger-bot/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
