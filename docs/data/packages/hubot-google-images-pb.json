hubot-google-images\n\nA hubot script that interacts with the Google Custom Search API for greater\nproductivity and lulz.\n\nSee [`src/google-images.coffee`](src/google-images.coffee) for full documentation.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn hubot project repo, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-google-images --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-google-images** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"hubot-google-images\"\n]\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Custom Search Engine\nGoogle no longer offers an unregistered image search API. You must set up a\n[Google Custom Search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/overview) and set\nthe environment variables `HUBOT_GOOGLE_CSE_ID` and `HUBOT_GOOGLE_CSE_KEY`.\n\nThe Custom Search API provides up to [100 search queries per day](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview) for free.\nIf you need more than that you'll have to pay.\n\n#### CSE setup details\n1. Create a CSE via these [instructions](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/tutorial/creatingcse).\n  - To simulate the old behavior:  select \"Search the entire web but emphasize included sites\" in 'Sites to Search'\n  - Give it any site on creation, and then remove it when it's selected, unless you want to emphasize that site(s).\n2. Turn on images in Edit Search Engine > Setup > Basic > Image Search\n3. Get the CSE ID in Edit Search Engine > Setup > Basic > Details (via [these instructions](https://support.google.com/customsearch/answer/2649143?hl=en))\n4. Get the CSE KEY here https://code.google.com/apis/console\n  - You will need a project, you may reuse an existing one, or create a new one\n  - Select the project\n  - Goto the API manager and create a server credential and use the key from that credential\n5. Enable Custom Search API\n  - https://console.developers.google.com\n  - Select \"Enable APIs and get credentials like keys\" in your new project\n  - Click \"Custom Search API\"\n  - Click the button \"Enable API\"\n6. Update your conf (and your modules if necessary)\n\n### Custom Mustachification Service\n\nTo enable the `mustache me` feature, set the environment variable  `HUBOT_MUSTACHIFY_URL`\nto your mustachify server url. More info and the source code of mustachify can be\nfound at [https://github.com/afeld/mustachio](https://github.com/afeld/mustachio)\n\n### Listen for `image me` and `animate me`\n\nIf you want to have your bot respond to any chat that begins with `image me` or\n`animate me`, you can add `HUBOT_GOOGLE_IMAGES_HEAR` to a non-empty value to\nhave the robot listen to all chat.\n\n## Sample Interaction\n\n```\nuser1>> hubot image me bananas\nhubot>> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Bananas.jpg\nuser2>> hubot animate me it's happening\nhubot>> http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--8U6TKXoi--/thfydh8egnt8he5esoz8.gif\nuser3>> hubot mustache me family portrait\nhubot>> http://mustachify.me/1?src=http://www.daviddanielsphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Chowen-Family-Portraits-east-of-Park-City-13.jpg\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"pbuckleyofnpm","email":"buckmeisterq@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-09-28T00:02:47.116Z","created":"2017-09-27T23:44:04.081Z","0.2.7":"2017-09-27T23:44:04.081Z","0.2.8":"2017-09-27T23:56:56.747Z","0.2.9":"2017-09-28T00:02:47.116Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/dx-pbuckley/hubot-google-images#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/dx-pbuckley/hubot-google-images.git"},"author":{"name":"Josh Nichols","email":"technicalpickles@github.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dx-pbuckley/hubot-google-images/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
