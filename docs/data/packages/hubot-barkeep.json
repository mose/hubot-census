For example,\r\nif you're a fan of stout, ask your bot to beer you some stout by typing `hubot beer me stout`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<You> hubot beer me stout\r\n<hubot> Give this beer a try:\r\n<hubot> Stone Brewing Co. Coffee Milk Stout\r\n<hubot> Stout - Milk / Sweet\r\n<hubot> URL: http://www.stonebrewing.com/\r\n```\r\n\r\nMmmmm... Coffee stout.\r\n\r\nLet's say that *types* of beer aren't really your style and you just like beers from certain *breweries*. The Untappd API allows \r\nyou to search for beer based on a brewery or a beer type. Try replacing `stout` with `boulevard`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<You> hubot beer me boulevard\r\n<hubot> Give this beer a try:\r\n<hubot> Boulevard Brewing Co. Collaboration No. 5 - Tropical Pale Ale\r\n<hubot> Pale Ale - American\r\n<hubot> URL: http://www.boulevard.com/\r\n```\r\n\r\nTropical Pale Ale huh? I might have to try that sometime.\r\n\r\nUntappd will get upset if you don't provide it a term or if you provide it a term that it doesn't recognize:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<You> hubot beer me asdljfkhsdlkjfh\r\n<hubot> Couldn't find a beer for you. Try again.\r\n<You> hubot beer me\r\n<hubot> Error occurred: 500 error text: You didn't search for anything! Please try again.\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust be sure to provide the script a term it can use to search with and everything will be ok.\r\n\r\n## Powered by\r\n\r\n[![Untappd](./img/pbu_80_yellow.png)](http://untappd.com)\r\n\r\n[![CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/documentation/images/logo.png)](http://coffeescript.org/)\r\n\r\n[Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/)","maintainers":[{"name":"jvarness","email":"jake.varness@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-01-11T15:02:58.907Z","created":"2015-11-27T16:36:21.472Z","0.1.0":"2015-11-27T16:36:21.472Z","0.1.1":"2016-01-11T15:02:58.907Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jvarness/hubot-barkeep","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","untappd"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/jvarness/hubot-barkeep.git"},"author":{"name":"Jake Varness","email":"jake.varness@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jvarness/hubot-barkeep/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
