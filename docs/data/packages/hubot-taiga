Tested in Let's Chat and Slack.\n- Make changes to Taiga User Stories (more coming soon) with chat commands. \n- Same syntax as Taiga [git commit messages.](https://taiga.io/support/changing-elements-status-via-commit-message/)\n\n![Screenshot](demo.png)\n\n# Install\n\nhubot-taiga is in active development and not finished yet. \nExpect bugs and breaking changes until version 1.0.\n\n1. Make sure hubot is set up and redis is working (optional)\n2. Copy `taiga.coffee` to `<your hubot>/scripts/`\n3. Set username/password as environment variables. I use a special Hubot user made in Taiga.io. User should have admin privledges.\n`HUBOT_TAIGA_USERNAME` and `HUBOT_TAIGA_PASSWORD` and optional `HUBOT_TAIGA_PROJECT`\nOr just hard code them in the file (not great for upgrading script).\n4. Restart hubot\n\n# Usage\n\nCommands\n\n- `taiga info` - view hubot-taiga settings\n- `taiga project <project slug>` - Set project per channel\n- `taiga auth <username> <password>` - Log in to post comments as your Taiga.io user\n- `TG-REF Your comment` Add a comment where REF is the User Story reference.\nExample `TG-123 I think this is a great idea`\nand `TG-123 #done I finished it, I am the best.`\n\n# Developing\n\nThere are many ways to work on hubot scripts. Here is how I do it.\n\n## Docker\n\nThis method uses docker-compose\n\n1. Clone this repo\n2. Run `docker-compose run --rm hubot bash`\n3. Run inside the container `bin/hubot`\n\n## Without Docker\n\n1. Clone this repo\n2. Install a new hubot just for testing.\n3. `cd` to your new hubot install\n4. Set environment variables (see INSTALLATION). I write a small script for this.\n5. Run hubot like `bin/hubot`\n6. Test out your command. You will need to restart hubot for each change.\n7. Submit a merge request with better instructions (Auto-restart? Debugging?)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"bufke","email":"david@burkesoftware.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-10-03T17:33:51.627Z","created":"2015-10-03T17:30:20.958Z","1.0.0":"2015-10-03T17:30:20.958Z","1.0.1":"2015-10-03T17:33:51.627Z"},"homepage":"https://gitlab.com/burke-software/hubot-taiga#README","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","taiga.io"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://gitlab.com/burke-software/hubot-taiga.git"},"author":{"name":"david@burkesoftware.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://gitlab.com/burke-software/hubot-taiga/issues"},"license":"GPL-3.0","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
