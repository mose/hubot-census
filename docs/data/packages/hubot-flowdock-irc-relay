an IRC channel with a Flowdock flow via Hubot.\n\nThis relay server will listen to incoming messages in a flow and a channel and relay them to each other.\n\nIt will also immitate an IRC client for each flowdock user in the flow and disguise messages as if they're written by that user.\n\nFor now, the relay server defaults to posting its error messages into the flow. This might be changed in the future, but for now, will help with identifying problems.\n\nNOTES:\n\n- Currently, as Flowdock doesn't provide an API for distinguishing whether a user is online or just registered to a specific flow, all registered users will be relayed to the IRC channel. This might prove to be confusing. Would love to implement a workaround if someone provides one.\n- When relaying to flowdock, the IRC channel is added to the message: `(#channel_name) user: message`. This is used as an identifier to prevent echoing.\n- When relaying to IRC, A `(flowdock)` string is added to the message. This is used as an identifier to prevent echoing.\n- This relay server currently has no real direct dependency in Hubot. That is, Hubot it simply used as an executor.\n- This is currently written in javascript, not coffeescript (DUH!)\n\n### Required Environment Variables\n\nThe following environment varaibles must be set:\n\n```shell\n# The Flowdock email you want to use (also the default relay user)\nHUBOT_FLOWDOCK_LOGIN_EMAIL\n# The flowdock password for the user\nHUBOT_FLOWDOCK_LOGIN_PASSWORD\n# The flowid of the flow to relay (e.g. 080cded7-aeea-446f-a1bb-5f5e09e66f54)\nHUBOT_FLOWDOCK_IRC_FLOWID\n# The IRC channel's name to relay (e.g. #test_irc_channel)\nHUBOT_FLOWDOCK_IRC_CHANNEL\n# The IRC server to use (e.g. irc.freenode.com)\nHUBOT_FLOWDOCK_IRC_SERVER\n# The default relay client to use (e.g. cosmo-admin)\nHUBOT_FLOWDOCK_IRC_RELAY_CLIENT\n# Whether heartbeat messages should be sent to the flow (defaults to False. Any other value will be True)\nHEARTBEAT_ENABLED\n# The interval in which heatbeat messages are sent (defaults to 43200000 (12 hours))\nHEARTBEAT_INTERVAL\n# The flow to send the heartbeat message to (defaults to HUBOT_FLOWDOCK_IRC_FLOWID)\nHEARTBEAT_FLOWID\n# The heartbeat message to send (defaults to 'Flowdock-IRC Relay is still ALIVE! MUHAHAHAHA')\nHEARTBEAT_MESSAGE\n```\n\n### Getting Started\n\nIn your `package.json`, add the following:\n\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"hubot-flowdock-irc-relay\": \">=0.0.4\",\n    },\n\nAnd in `external-scripts.json` make sure you have:\n\n    ['hubot-flowdock-irc-relay']\n\n### Usage\n\nWell, since the relay server simply runs in the background, there really is nothing you need to do.\n\nIn the future, a server management interface might be added so that you're able to hotswap channels, sign in as specific clients, and more...\n","maintainers":[{"name":"nir0s","email":"nir36g@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-01-21T19:30:47.692Z","created":"2014-09-26T09:33:11.682Z","0.0.1":"2014-09-26T09:33:11.682Z","0.0.2":"2014-09-26T09:40:26.511Z","0.0.3":"2014-09-26T13:12:27.374Z","0.0.4":"2014-09-28T17:11:14.497Z","0.0.5":"2014-10-04T06:35:53.211Z","0.0.6":"2015-01-21T18:41:03.735Z","0.0.7":"2015-01-21T19:30:47.692Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/hubot-flowdock-irc-relay","keywords":["irc","hubot","flowdock","bot"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/hubot-flowdock-irc-relay"},"author":{"name":"nir0s"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/hubot-flowdock-irc-relay/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md"}
