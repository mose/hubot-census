Hubot Team [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-team.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-team)\n\nCreate and manage the members of a team using Hubot.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd **hubot-team** to your `package.json` file:\n\n```json\n\"dependencies\": {\n  ...\n  \"hubot-team\": \"latest\"\n}\n```\n\nAdd **hubot-team** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\"hubot-team\"]\n```\n\nRun `npm install hubot-team`\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nSome commands require an admin role to be run (i.e. `clear` team list). The\nadmins can be specified through the `HUBOT_TEAM_ADMIN` environment variable,\nas a comma separated list of usernames.\n\n\n## Commands\n\n    hubot create <team_name> team               # create team called <team_name>\n    hubot (delete|remove) <team_name> team      # delete team called <team_name>\n    hubot list teams                            # list all existing teams\n    hubot (<team_name>) team +1                 # add me to the team\n    hubot (<team_name>) team -1                 # remove me from the team\n    hubot (<team_name>) team add (me|<user>)    # add me or <user> to team\n    hubot (<team_name>) team remove (me|<user>) # remove me or <user> from team\n    hubot (<team_name>) team (list|show)        # list the people in the team\n    hubot (<team_name>) team (empty|clear)      # clear team list\n    hubot (<team_name>) team count              # list the current size of the team\n\nAll commands that have the `<team_name>` in parantheses can ommit it. For example:\n\n    hubot team +1\n\nwould work just fine, adding the current user to the default team. Note: when\nadding and removing users without the `<team_name>` label, those users are\nincluded in a team that does not show up when running `hubot list teams`.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you are interested to make `hubot-team` better, fork this repository, check\nthe list of [open issues](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-team/issues?state=open)\n(old issues list can be found [here](https://github.com/mihai/hubot-team/issues?state=open))\nfor some suggestions to get started, and submit a pull request.\n\nFeel free to add yourself to the\n[CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-team/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS)\nlist while submitting a pull request.\n\n## License\n&copy; 2014 [Mihai Cîrlănaru](http://www.mihai-cirlanaru.com)\n\nSee [LICENSE](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-team/blob/master/LICENSE) for more details.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"mihai","email":"mihai@cirlanaru.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-02-07T04:20:44.631Z","created":"2014-05-18T20:57:20.757Z","1.0.0":"2014-05-18T20:57:20.757Z","1.0.1":"2014-05-31T21:56:33.821Z","1.0.2":"2014-05-31T23:07:09.461Z","1.0.3":"2014-06-02T10:05:03.771Z","1.0.4":"2014-06-02T21:44:30.106Z","1.0.5":"2014-07-20T20:09:44.884Z","1.0.6":"2014-07-20T20:16:02.721Z","1.0.7":"2014-07-20T20:36:01.603Z","1.0.8":"2014-08-31T15:24:46.829Z","1.0.9":"2014-08-31T16:21:39.239Z","1.0.10":"2014-08-31T16:27:02.802Z","2.0.0":"2014-12-07T13:29:12.367Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-team","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","team"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-team.git"},"author":{"name":"Mihai Cîrlănaru","email":"mihai@cirlanaru.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-team/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"xslim":true,"evert0n":true}}
