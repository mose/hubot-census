","readme":"# hubot-aws-v2\n\nHubot script to manage your AWS environment in a visually appealing and functional way.\n\nThis plugin can be used to interact with AWS and had some enhancements compared to other aws scripts that are available.\n\nThis is very much a work in progress and has bugs. Please feel free to report any here on GitHub and Pull Requests are more than welcome.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n* These plugins only work with Rocket.Chat and Slack at the moment. It may very well work with other chat systems, but these are the only two that I have tested for consistant functionality.\n\n* The filter when listing instances is case sensitve.\n\n## Setup/Configuration\n\nThe following environment variables must be set before this pacakge will start working. (In addition to any that need to be set for the particular adapter that you are using)\n\nEnvironment Variable | Description | Example\n:---- | :---- | :----\nHUBOT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | AWS Access Key | AKIAJXXXXXXSSSSQYZKQ\nHUBOT_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | AWS Secret Access Key | tSEz9uvDXXXXXXXqO5yXXFGmXXnXXGXXZRj8XXXX\nHUBOT_AWS_REGION | Main AWS Region you will be interacting with. | ap-southeast-2\nHUBOT_AWS_S3_BUCKET | Bucket Short-Name used at the moment only to store screenshots retrieved with the Console Screenshot script. | my-bucket/console-screenshots\nHUBOT_AWS_S3_URL | URL including folder path of where the console screenshots will be stored. This is used to build the URL where the screenshot is stored. | https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/console-screenshots/\n\n## Installation\n\nIn hubot project repo, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-aws-v2 --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-aws-v2** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"hubot-aws-v2\"\n]\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\n\nCopy the following files into your own hubot install\n\n* aws.coffee\n* scripts/ec2_console_screenshot.coffee\n* scripts/ec2_list.coffee\n\naws.coffee shoukd be in the hubot root as its included by all the scripts to set the auth environment vars.\n\n## NPM Module\n\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-aws-v2\n\n\n## Sample Interactions and Available Commands\n\nSee screenshots at the end to see what the output looks like. \n\n### aws ec2 ls\n\nWill return a complete listing of your EC2 Instances under the configured region.\n\n### aws ec2 ls < Filter >\n\n```\nhubot> aws ec2 ls SQL\n```\n\nThis will filter the list by the Name tag in AWS.\n\nSo running the above will only return results where SQL is anywhere in the \"Name\" tag.\n\n### aws ec2 console < Instance ID>\n\n```\nhubot> aws ec2 console i-077f7532a8f58cabf\n```\n\nGenerates and captures a screenshot of the instance console. Very useful if the instance has become unreachable via SSH or RDP - the physical console often contains log messages or other clues that can be used to identify and understand what’s going on when things are not working as expected.\n\n## To-Do\n\n* Re-implement roles so that only users with a particular role can execute the commands. \n* Fix up case sensitivty on the instance listing \n* Test with more adapters instead of just rocket.chat and slack\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![list](https://github.com/jszaszvari/hubot-aws-v2/blob/master/ec2_console_screenshot.png?raw=true)\n\n![console](https://github.com/jszaszvari/hubot-aws-v2/blob/master/ec2_list_screenshot.png?raw=true)\n","versions":{"0.0.2":{"name":"hubot-aws-v2","version":"0.0.2","private":false,"author":{"name":"John Szaszvari","email":"jszaszvari@gmail.com"},"description":"hubot-aws-v2","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/jszaszvari/hubot-aws-v2.git"},"dependencies":{"aws-sdk":"^2.77.0","hubot":"^2.19.0","hubot-diagnostics":"0.0.1","hubot-help":"^0.2.0","hubot-redis-brain":"0.0.3","hubot-rocketchat":"^1.0.8","hubot-slack":"^4.3.4","moment":"^2.18.1","tsv":"^0.2.0"},"engines":{"node":"0.10.x"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jszaszvari/hubot-aws-v2/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jszaszvari/hubot-aws-v2","gitHead":"062e3d3e57896f07f17b8205a7973f3731767699","_id":"hubot-aws-v2@0.0.2","_npmVersion":"5.0.3","_nodeVersion":"8.1.2","_npmUser":{"name":"jszaszvari","email":"jszaszvari+new@gmail.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-WiMZ4NAoHPgNjxl9crptcZgXKMhScceXQpA9g6hE3cpdhfRlp7yFCzyywkXbxCVjlZIx0t0tF1rDpNr2IfO2qg==","shasum":"5b0ba428b95e23e2a3b2deb4ffbe43b1980add41","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/hubot-aws-v2/-/hubot-aws-v2-0.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jszaszvari","email":"jszaszvari+new@gmail.com"}],"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/hubot-aws-v2-0.0.2.tgz_1499384638307_0.19930245261639357"}},"0.0.3":{"name":"hubot-aws-v2","description":"Hubot script to manage your AWS environment in a visually appealing and functional way.
