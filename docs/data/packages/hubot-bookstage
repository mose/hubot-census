hubot-bookstage\n\nBookstage manages who is currently using your team's staging server\n\nBased on the original code of tinifni: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/stagehand.coffee\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst run `npm install hubot-bookstage --save`, then add `hubot-bookstage` to the `external-scripts.json` file.\n\n## Usage\n\n- `hubot bookstage add <env> [category]`: Add a new server. 'bs' is an alias for 'bookstage'.\n- `hubot bookstage book <env> [<hours> <reason>]`: Book a server. Default is 1 hour.\n- `hubot bookstage cancel <env>`: Cancel a booking.\n- `hubot bookstage list`: List status of all staging servers.\n- `hubot bookstage who <env>`: Show status of a single server.\n\n## Configuration\n\nIf you would like the status to be monospace, set `HUBOT_BOOKSTAGE_MONOSPACE_WRAPPER` env variable to a string that will be used to wrap the status. For instance, slack would be `HUBOT_BOOKSTAGE_MONOSPACE_WRAPPER='\\`\\`\\`'`\n","maintainers":[{"name":"nhoel","email":"nathanhoel@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-07-12T14:04:00.875Z","created":"2016-03-27T18:36:44.632Z","0.1.0":"2016-03-27T18:36:44.632Z","0.2.0":"2016-03-27T21:24:58.168Z","0.2.1":"2016-03-27T22:33:23.066Z","0.2.2":"2016-03-28T06:08:15.857Z","0.3.0":"2016-03-30T03:28:12.800Z","1.0.0":"2016-03-30T19:49:26.395Z","1.1.0":"2016-07-12T14:04:00.875Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/nathanhoel/hubot-bookstage","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","staging","server","checkout"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/nathanhoel/hubot-bookstage.git"},"author":{"name":"Nathan Hoel"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nathanhoel/hubot-bookstage/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
