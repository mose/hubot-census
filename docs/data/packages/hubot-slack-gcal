It also has the ability to remind users of upcoming events and notifying users when their events are updated.\n\n![](servo-calendar.gif)\n\n## Configuration\n\nThis script depends on the [hubot-slack-google-auth](https://github.com/Skookum/hubot-slack-google-auth) script, which should com first in your `external-scripts.json` file. In addition to the environment variables described there, make sure `HUBOT_GOOGLE_SCOPES` variable contains `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`.\n\n### Webhooks\n\nCalendar reminders & event updates depend on [push notifications](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/push). For these to work, you'll need to register the domain of your hubot instance (should be the same as the `HUBOT_URL` env variable) in the developer console and verify ownership using webmaster tools. Whenever someone enables calendar reminders, the script will handle creating and renewing the webhook.\n\n### Resources\n\nYou can also query and book resources using this script by putting a `calendar-resources.json` file in your hubot's root directory. The format looks like this:\n\n```js\n{\n  // Key is the name of the \"group\" this resource belongs to, used in commands like:\n  // \"hubot what team rooms are available\"\n  \"team room\": {\n    // Resource ID                                      // array of aliases for this resource\n    \"yourteam.com_abc123@resource.calendar.google.com\": [\"1 - HAL 9000\", \"team room 1\", \"team room one\", \"tr1\", \"tr 1\"]\n  },\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Creating events\n\n- `hubot create event <quick add text>` - create a new event on your primary calendar using the given [quick add text](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/reference/events/quickAdd).\n- `hubot book <resource> for <quick add text>` - creates an event (as above) and invites the given resource. Requires adding a `calendar-resources.json` file as described above. Resource name for this command can be any one of the aliases you defined.\n\n### Enable reminders\n\n- `hubot enable calendar reminders` - enable reminders for upcoming events and notifications when events are added/changed/removed. All reminders are sent via DM. Behind the scenes this sets up a webhook that will notify hubot whenever events are updated.\n- `hubot disable calendar reminders` - turns off event reminders and updates\n\n### Replying to events\n\nWhenever hubot send you an event (after creating it, in a reminder, etc.) you can send the following commands to act on it:\n\n- `hubot reply <yes/no/maybe>` - RSVP to the event (if you're invited)\n- `hubot invite <list of slack names>` - invites the given Slack user(s) to the event\n\n### Querying resources\n\n- `hubot what <resource group>s are available` - tells you which resources in the given group (if any) are free for the next hour.","maintainers":[{"name":"dbecher","email":"david@skookum.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-04-23T19:04:52.050Z","created":"2015-04-23T19:04:52.050Z","0.1.0":"2015-04-23T19:04:52.050Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Skookum/hubot-slack-gcal","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","google","calendar"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/Skookum/hubot-slack-gcal"},"author":{"name":"David Becher","email":"david@skookum.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Skookum/hubot-slack-gcal/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"eric1599":true}}
