Add `hubot-mimic` to your `package.json`:\n\n```json\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"hubot-mimic\": \"~0.1.2\"\n  },\n```\n\n2. Require the module in `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\"hubot-mimic\"]\n```\n\n3. Run `npm update` and restart your Hubot.\n\n## Commands\n\nSaying anything at all in chat appends to the model. The robot is always\nwatching!\n\n`Hubot: mimic edith` will randomly generate text based on the current contents of\nits model for the user 'edith'.\n\n`Hubot: mimic all` will randomly generate text based on the current contents of\nits model.\n\n`Hubot: mimic all your mother is a` will generate a random phrase seeded with\nthe phrase you give it. This command might output \"your mother is a classy\nlady\", for example. Remember: Hubot is an innocent soul, and what he says\nonly acts as a mirror for everything in your hearts.\n\n## Configuring\n\nThe Hubot markov model can optionally be configured by two environment\nvariables:\n\n`HUBOT_MARKOV_PLY` controls the *order* of the model that's built; effectively,\nhow many previous states (words) are considered to choose the next state. You\ncan bump this up if you'd like, but the default of 1 is both economical with\nstorage and maximally hilarious.\n\n`HUBOT_MARKOV_LEARN_MIN` controls the minimum length of a phrase that will\nbe used to train the model, default 1. Set this higher to avoid training your\nmodel with a bunch of immediate terminal transitions like \"lol\".\n\n`HUBOT_MARKOV_GENERATE_MAX` controls the maximum size of a markov chain that will be\ngenerated by the \"markov\" command.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jfhamlin","email":"jfhamlin@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-06-08T16:14:57.422Z","created":"2014-07-07T18:10:44.467Z","0.1.0":"2014-07-07T18:10:44.467Z","0.1.1":"2014-07-07T18:39:51.852Z","0.1.2":"2015-06-08T16:14:57.422Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jfhamlin/hubot-mimic","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","markov"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/jfhamlin/hubot-mimic.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Ash Wilson","email":"smashwilson@gmail.com"},{"name":"Kyle Kelley","email":"rgbkrk@gmail.com"},{"name":"Todd Berman","email":"tberman@off.net"},{"name":"James Hamlin","email":"jfhamlin@gmail.com"}],"author":{"name":"Ash Wilson","email":"smashwilson@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jfhamlin/hubot-mimic/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"metagard":true,"putna":true}}
