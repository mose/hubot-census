Note that you would not get updates from the `hubot-hall-scripts` repository unless you copy them yourself.\n\nAny third-party dependencies for scripts need the addition of your\n`package.json` otherwise a lot of errors will be thrown during the start up of your hubot. You can find a list of dependencies for a script in the\ndocumentation header at the top of the script.\n\n## Documentation\n\nAll scripts in hubot-hall-scripts contain a documentation header so people know every thing about the script.\n\n```coffeescript\n# Description\n#   <description of the scripts functionality>\n#\n# Dependencies:\n#   \"<module name>\": \"<module version>\"\n#\n# Configuration:\n#   LIST_OF_ENV_VARS_TO_SET\n#\n# Commands:\n#   hubot <trigger> - <what the respond trigger does>\n#   <trigger> - <what the hear trigger does>\n#\n# Notes:\n#   <optional notes required for the script>\n#\n# Author:\n#   <github username of the original script author>\n```\n\n[hubot]: https://github.com/github/hubot\n[Hall]: http://www.hall.com\n[hall-sound-me]: https://github.com/fernandodev/hubot-hall-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/hall-sound-me.coffee\n[irb]: https://github.com/fernandodev/hubot-hall-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/irb.coffee\n","maintainers":[{"name":"fernandodev","email":"fernando.xps@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2013-12-12T20:55:10.014Z","created":"2013-12-12T20:55:07.176Z","1.0.1":"2013-12-12T20:55:10.014Z"},"author":{"name":"fernandodev"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/fernandodev/hubot-hall-scripts.git"}}
