Whereas, the fire method should do your own logic, for example sending a message to the room indicating that there is something wrong (using the sensor's notify method).\n\nFinally, from your sensor's constructor you should invoke to the parent's constructor (super method) passing the frecuency time, in miliseconds, that your sensor will be checked, and an optional boolean parameter to indicate if the sensor should be activated when is loaded.\n\nIn the default_sensors folder your will find some examples that can help you to implement your own sensors.\n\n## Current commands\n\n    sensors list - List all sensors loaded\n    sensors list enabled - List all sensors enabled\n    sensors list disabled - List all sensors disabled\n    sensors enable <sensor_name> - Enable the sensor requested\n    sensors disable <sensor_name> - Enable the sensor requested\n\n## Example\n    hubot sensors list\n\nWill output:\n\n    Current list of sensors:\n    CountDownSensor\t\tA count down sensor fired each 10 minutes\n    WeatherSensor    \tInfo of WeatherSensor\n","versions":{"1.1.0":{"name":"hubot-sensors","description":"A hubot script to create and manage hubot sensors.","version":"1.1.0","author":{"name":"David Basoco","email":"basoko@gmail.com"},"license":"MIT","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","meme"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/basoko/hubot-sensors.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/basoko/hubot-sensors/issues"},"dependencies":{"coffee-script":"~1.6"},"devDependencies":{"mocha":"*","chai":"*","sinon-chai":"*","sinon":"*"},"main":"index.coffee","scripts":{"test":"script/test"},"homepage":"https://github.com/basoko/hubot-sensors","_id":"hubot-sensors@1.1.0","dist":{"shasum":"6ff6bbfc116ab899825d595b3fd1afe308512f77","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hubot-sensors/-/hubot-sensors-1.1.0.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.4.6","_npmUser":{"name":"basoko","email":"basoko@gmail.com"},"maintainers":[{"name":"basoko","email":"basoko@gmail.com"}]},"1.1.1":{"name":"hubot-sensors","description":"A hubot script to create and manage hubot sensors.","version":"1.1.1","author":{"name":"David Basoco","email":"basoko@gmail.com"},"license":"MIT","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","sensors"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/basoko/hubot-sensors.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/basoko/hubot-sensors/issues"},"dependencies":{"coffee-script":"~1.6"},"devDependencies":{"mocha":"*","chai":"*","sinon-chai":"*","sinon":"*"},"main":"index.coffee","scripts":{"test":"script/test"},"homepage":"https://github.com/basoko/hubot-sensors","_id":"hubot-sensors@1.1.1","dist":{"shasum":"a5adade69dc31ebcc7ee0d700d5acc14837770f7","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hubot-sensors/-/hubot-sensors-1.1.1.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.4.3","_npmUser":{"name":"basoko","email":"basoko@gmail.com"},"maintainers":[{"name":"basoko","email":"basoko@gmail.com"}]}},"homepage":"https://github.com/basoko/hubot-sensors","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","sensors"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/basoko/hubot-sensors.git"},"author":{"name":"David Basoco","email":"basoko@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/basoko/hubot-sensors/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"matteosp":true,"brentmaxwell":true}}
