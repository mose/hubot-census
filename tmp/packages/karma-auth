So here's the classic karma script\r\nrepackaged in the new npm package style format.  Use as you will.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n    <thing>++ - give thing some karma\r\n    <thing>-- - take away some of thing's karma\r\n    hubot karma <thing> - check thing's karma (if <thing> is omitted, show the top 5)\r\n    hubot karma empty <thing> - empty a thing's karma\r\n    hubot karma best - show the top 5\r\n    hubot karma worst - show the bottom 5\r\n\r\n### Installation (new style):\r\n\r\n1. cd into your hubot dir, run `npm install --save hubot-karma-classic` (adds a dependency in package.json).\r\n2. Add `\"hubot-karma-classic\"` to your `external-scripts.json` file.\r\n3. Restart Hubot.\r\n\r\n### Installation (old style):\r\n\r\nPlace hubot-karma-class.coffee to your hubot/scripts directory. Restart hubot.\r\n","maintainers":[{"name":"gcyrus","email":"dev@lawl.io"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-06-20T19:07:21.486Z","created":"2016-06-20T17:36:48.551Z","1.0.0":"2016-06-20T17:36:48.551Z","1.0.1":"2016-06-20T17:50:41.166Z","1.0.2":"2016-06-20T17:56:08.318Z","1.0.3":"2016-06-20T18:00:01.373Z","1.0.4":"2016-06-20T18:36:36.451Z","1.0.5":"2016-06-20T18:39:38.379Z","1.0.6":"2016-06-20T18:42:30.351Z","1.0.7":"2016-06-20T18:44:31.443Z","1.0.8":"2016-06-20T18:48:40.372Z","1.0.9":"2016-06-20T18:54:24.023Z","1.0.10":"2016-06-20T18:59:28.771Z","1.0.11":"2016-06-20T19:01:44.527Z","1.0.12":"2016-06-20T19:04:14.592Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/gcyrus/hubot-karma-classic","keywords":["hubot","karma"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/gcyrus/hubot-karma-classic.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Andy Beger","url":"https://github.com/abeger"},{"name":"Grant Cyrus"}],"author":{"name":"D.
