You can give people karma and you can take away your karma, but you\ncan't give negative karma.\n\nhubot-good-karma uses fuzzy matching for names, so you can say things like\n\"anish++\" and \"anish--\" in chat to modify karma for the user \"anishathalye.\n\n## Demo\n\n![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anishathalye/hubot-good-karma/docs/demo.png)\n\n## Installation\n\nIn hubot project repo, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-good-karma --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-good-karma** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"hubot-good-karma\"\n]\n```\n\n**If you want to be able to change configuration settings from the chat without\nhaving to use environment variables, you should also install\n[hubot-conf][hubot-conf].**\n\n## Usage\n\nhubot-good-karma is pretty intuitive to use. Say \"{user}++\" to give someone\nkarma, and say \"{user}--\" to take it away. You don't even have to say the full\nusername because hubot-good-karma does fuzzy username matching.\n\nRun the help command (`{botname} help karma`) in your chat to see more\ndocumentation.\n\n## Tips\n\n* Take advantage of the `HUBOT_KARMA_BLACKLIST_NAME` setting to make things\n  like saying \"c++\" not give random people karma.\n\n## Configuration\n\nhubot-good-karma can be configured either using [hubot-conf][hubot-conf] or\nenvironment variables. hubot-conf settings override environment variables.\n\nFor all of the settings below like `HUBOT_SETTING_NAME`, you can change the\nsetting via chat by saying `{botname} conf set setting.name \"{new value}\"` (the\nsetting name is mapped by skipping the `HUBOT_` part, changing to lowercase,\nand replacing `_` with `.`).\n\n* `HUBOT_KARMA_TOP` - a number indicating how many people to show in the\n  leaderboard. This setting defaults to `5`.\n\n* `HUBOT_KARMA_BLACKLIST_ROOM` - a comma-separated list of rooms where karma is\n  disabled. This variable can also be left unset, which is the default.\n\n* `HUBOT_KARMA_BLACKLIST_NAME` - comma-separated list of names for which karma\n  is disabled. This variable can also be left unset, which is the default.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Anish Athalye. Released under the MIT License.
