The header isn't updated if the on-call engineer hasn't changed.\n\nSee [`src/whos-on-call.coffee`](src/whos-on-call.coffee) for full documentation.\n\n**NOTE: This script requires at least version 3.4.0 of [hubot-matteruser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-matteruser)**\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install hubot-whos-on-call-mattermost`\n\nThen add **hubot-whos-on-call-attermost** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"whos-on-call-mattermost\"\n]\n```\n\n## Triggering the script\n\nMake an HTTP POST request to `{HUBOT_HOST}/webhook/on-call/:channel_name`\n\nThe post body must contain a key called `secret` that should match the environment variable `WHOS_ON_CALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. This will ensure only authorized clients can trigger the script.\n\nThe post body can optionally contain a `header` key that specifies the text to set the header to. The string `$ENGINEER` in this variable will be replaced with the on-call engineer's name (as given by pagerduty). Not specifying this value will trigger the use of the `WHOS_ON_CALL_HEADER_TEMPLATE` environment variable.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"cadecairos","email":"chris@chrisdecairos.ca"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-10-02T01:54:09.567Z","created":"2016-09-29T14:12:03.970Z","1.0.0":"2016-09-29T14:12:03.970Z","1.1.0":"2016-10-02T01:54:09.567Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/cadecairos/hubot-whos-on-call-mattermost#readme","keywords":["mattermost","pagerduty","hubot"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/cadecairos/hubot-whos-on-call-mattermost.git"},"author":{"name":"Christopher De Cairos"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/cadecairos/hubot-whos-on-call-mattermost/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
