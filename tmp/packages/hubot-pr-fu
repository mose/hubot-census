It was\ninitially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot]. The npm\nmodule name is `hubot-pr-fu`.\n\n[hubot]: http://hubot.github.com\n[generator-hubot]: https://github.com/github/generator-hubot\n\n### Installing the script\n\n#### Integrating with exisiting bot\n\nInstall the script via `npm`:\n\n    npm install hubot-pr-fu --save\n\nAdd the script to your `external-scripts.json` file:\n\n    [ \"hubot-pr-fu\" ]\n\nAnd start your bot\n\n\n#### Running hubot-pr-fu Locally\n\nYou can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not\nbehave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely\nupon have been set.\n\nYou can start hubot-pr-fu locally by running:\n\n    % bin/hubot -a slack\n\n### Notes\n\n* There might be some inconsistency with determining the conflict of\n  PRs. GitHub's API returns a `mergeable` key in the response that has\n  three possible states: `true`, `false` and `nil`. `nil` state means\n  that the mergeability of that PR has not yet been determined, and a\n  background job has been scheduled. For reasons of making the logic\n  simpler, we don't display information about these `nil` state PRs. So\n  there might be a rare case where the total number of PRs in `pr all`\n  command doesn't match with the sum of mergeable PRs and non-mergeable\n  PRs in the same command's response.\n\n### Commands/Features\n\n__Note: This bot is still under active development, and so has really\nlittle error checking (existence of organization or repo, valid\npermissions etc.). User discretion is advised__\n\n#### User specific commands\n\n`pr orgname/repo all`\n\nThis command returns the PR stats for the repo specified under the\nspecified organization. This information would include:\n\n1. Total open PRs\n2. Total PRs which are mergeable and those which are not\n3. List of users who have open PRs and links to each of those\n\n`pr orgname/repo conflicts`\n\nThis command returns all the PRs which have merge conflicts. This has\nmore detailed information for those compared to `pr all` command.\nThe title, PR number, link to that PR, assignee and the username who\nopened this PR is included in the information.\n\n`pr orgname/repo <username>`\n\nThis command returns all the PRs opened by this user. This includes all\nopen PRs which are mergeable and non-mergeable. The `username` is\nassumed to be a valid Github username. For now, there is no\nauthorization or authentication built-in. Another assumption is that a\nusername in lowercase is same as capitalized or camelcased. That is, for\na username `bootstrap`, the users `Bootstrap`, `bootStrap` are the same.\n\nOne caveat is that the robot will treat every string after `pr`\nother than `all` and `conflicts` as a username. So, don't abuse this.\nAdding a way to make this better is in the works.\n\n### Configuration\n\n\nSome env vars are assumed to exist:\n\n* HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN (Get this from Slack account page)\n  [Read this for steps to obtain a slack token and set the bot name]( #getting-a-slack-token )\n  steps](#getting-a-slack-token) to know the name of the bot.\n* GH_AUTH_TOKEN (Get this from Github)\n\n#### Getting a Slack Token\n1. Signin into Slack via https://slack.com/signin\n2. Head to https://<teamname>.slack.com/services/new/bot\n3. Register a new bot with whatever name you want\n4. Save the service, and you'll be shown the API key. Grab this key and\nk  set it to `HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN`\n\n### Contribution\n\nAn example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to\nget started, along with the [Scripting Guide](scripting-docs).\n\n[scripting-docs]:
