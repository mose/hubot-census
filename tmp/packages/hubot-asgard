script for interacting with [Asgard](https://github.com/Netflix/asgard)\n\n## Goals\n* Allow an easy interface for quick (particularly read-only) data requests from Asgard. \n* Better mobile support via Campfire/Hipchat/XMPP/etc.\n* Templated ([eco](https://github.com/sstephenson/eco)) output allows easy customization for users.\n* Support basic and/or fundamental updates that should not require a browser to run.\n* Additional ACL via Hubot Admin and roles\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n[Asgard](https://github.com/Netflix/asgard) needs to be running somewhere, and Hubot needs to be able to access it. You can launch manually on AWS with a [NetflixOSS AMI](http://netflix.github.io/#amis) or one of [these](http://imperialwicket.com/netflix-asgard-12-ami-updates).\n\nIf you want a more hands-off approach, hubot-asgard comes bundled with some asgard-launcher commands. These are AWS-centric launch utilities for Asgard. After configuration in Hubot, you can launch a new Asgard instance as follows:\n\n    asgard-launcher run\n    asgard-launcher url\n    asgard-launcher authorize <HUBOT_IP>\n    asgard-launcher authorize <YOUR_IP>\n\nAfter configuring your Asgard instance via web browser, save a private AMI that includes your configured AWS credentials. Note that it is recommended to disable public AMIs when initially configuring your Asgard instance. If you need public AMIs be careful with the ami listing requests, as they may exceed message size limitations (and currently do not batch).\n\n    asgard-launcher create ami\n\nIf you want to shutdown the instance, use:\n\n    asgard-launcher terminate\n\nIf you created an ami, asgard-launcher will use that ami for future `asgard-launcher run` requests. If not, it will launch the default ami (requiring configuration) each time.\n\nAsgard-launcher defaults to launching the NetflixOSS AMI on an m1.small instance. Use `asgard-launcher ami <ami-id>` and `asgard-launcher instance type <instance-type>` to override these defaults. \n\n\n## Installation\n\nUpdate Hubot's package.json to install hubot-asgard from npm, and update Hubot's external-scripts.json file to include the hubot-asgard module.\n\n### Update the files to include the hubot-asgard module:\n\n#### package.json\n    ...\n    \"dependencies\": {\n      \"hubot\":        \">= 2.4.0 < 3.0.0\",\n      ...\n      \"hubot-asgard\": \">= 0.1.1\"\n    },\n    ...\n\n#### external-scripts.json\n    [\"hubot-awesome-module\",\"other-cool-npm-script\",\"hubot-asgard\"]\n\nRun `npm install` to install hubot-asgard and dependencies.\n\n\n## Configuration options\n\nHubot-asgard uses Redis to store information via robot.brain. On initial launch, hubot will try to load your HUBOT_ASGARD_URL and HUBOT_ASGARD_REGION from the like-named environment variables. If these are empty, Hubot uses 'http://127.0.0.1' and 'us-east-1'.\n\nYou can retrieve and update these values with Hubot via:\n\n    asgard url http://asgard.example.com:8080\n    asgard url\n    asgard region us-west-2\n    asgard region\n\nIf you plan to use asgard-launcher, you must set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables for successful aws-sdk configuration.\n\n\n## Practical Use\n\nUse `hubot help` or check the asgard.coffee file to get the full list of options with short descriptions. The steps below cover checking autoscaling groups and pushing a new ami to a particular autoscaling group. \n\nShow autoscaling groups:\n\n    asgard autoscaling\n    OR\n    a as\n\nShow a single autoscaling group:\n\n    a as autoscaling-group-name\n\nShow amis:\n\n    asgard ami\n\nStart a rolling push:\n\n    asgard rollingpush autoscaling-group-name ami-1234abcd\n\nCheck the rolling push task:\n\n    asgard task\n    asgard task 12\n\n\n## Templates\n\nHubot-asgard returns data via ([eco](https://github.com/sstephenson/eco)) templates. If you are missing data, or want to organize things differently, hit the Asgard web interface that corresponds to a request and append the url with '.json'. This should show you the data that's being passed to the template. Change the template in a fork and either rock your personal changes, or submit a pull request for everyone to enjoy.\n\n\n## Todo\n\n* List size checking, response batching. Need basic safety checks in case someone tries to get the list of all AMIs in us-east-1 (or has very large systems).\n* Implement roles - Use HUBOT admin, or entirely separate roles? Probably both.\n* Refine templating\n* Wrap additional services\n","maintainers":[{"name":"imperialwicket","email":"imperialwicket@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-10-03T15:17:37.790Z","created":"2013-08-29T07:02:29.640Z","0.1.1":"2013-08-29T07:02:31.298Z","0.1.3":"2013-08-31T03:58:38.301Z","0.2.0":"2013-09-02T05:29:30.364Z","0.2.1":"2013-09-02T08:21:09.665Z","0.2.2":"2013-09-02T08:41:09.885Z","0.2.3":"2013-09-23T05:59:30.171Z","0.2.4":"2014-08-15T15:37:54.273Z","0.2.5":"2016-10-03T15:17:37.790Z"},"author":{"name":"Nicholas Whittier","url":"http://imperialwicket.com"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/imperialwicket/hubot-asgard.git"},"users":{"imperialwicket":true},"homepage":"https://github.com/imperialwicket/hubot-asgard","keywords":["amazon","asgard","aws","ec2","auto scaling","netflixoss"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/imperialwicket/hubot-asgard/issues"},"license":{"type":"Apache License, Version 2.0","url":"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html"},"readmeFilename":"README.md"}
