Your\n`index.coffee` entry point will load the scripts from this directory.\n\n### test\n\nThis directory is home to any tests you write for your scripts. This example\npackage uses Mocha, Chai and Sinon to manage writing tests.\n\n## Advantages of Building a Package\n\nSome of the advantages of building an npm package for your hubot script(s) are:\n\n* You don't need to rely on when hubot-scripts package is released.\n* You can specify dependencies in the `package.json` rather than have users\n  manually specify them\n* You can easily add tests using your favourite frameworks and libraries\n","maintainers":[{"name":"aaccurso","email":"accurso.alan@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-10-07T01:09:56.669Z","created":"2014-10-07T00:31:49.373Z","1.0.0":"2014-10-07T00:31:49.373Z","1.0.1":"2014-10-07T01:09:56.669Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/aaccurso/hubot-facts","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","facts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git@github.com:aaccurso/hubot-facts.git"},"author":{"name":"aaccurso","email":"accurso.alan@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/aaccurso/hubot-facts/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
