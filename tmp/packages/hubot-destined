hubot-destined\n\nDestiny item search for slack-integrated hubot. Uses a raw feed acquired from Josh Hunt's [destiny.plumbing](https://github.com/joshhunt/destinyPlumbing) and provides item links to [destinydb](http://destinydb.com).\n\nIt will likely grow over time and may not always use the same data source or only link there, but hey, gotta start somewhere.\n\n## Use\nThe commands presently support refreshing data (use very sparingly) and search for an item by name/name fragment:\n\n```\nhubot find invect\nhubot link conspiracy theory\nhubot refresh data\n```\n\nThe search is case insensitive and _technically_ using regex. Get fancy and you'll probably blow something up or get nothing back.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn hubot project repo, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-destined --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-destined** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"hubot-destined\"\n]\n```\n\n## Technical notes\n\n### How it gets/stores data\nThis is pulling the raw JSON file for the full item list* and then creating/refreshing a local NeDB file. This could be the worst idea ever but I had stuff I could borrow from other projects to throw this together quickly and I only had a few hours to spend on it. It only does automatically the first time.\n\n* The processed feeds don't have the latest weapons or gear. I have no idea why. Instead of pestering Josh Hunt who already did us all a solid, I just use the raw feed he has also made available as JSON.\n\n### How it processes commands\nSo uh, at first glance a lot of this probably seems like overkill. I'm using another of my hubot project's structure partly because it was there, partly because it's easier to test and partly because I plan to add more stuff over time and I prefer this.\n\nHopefully that doesn't make it hard for anyone with time/interest to contribute to.\n\nThe `command.js` file is a hash of command names with an array of patterns that will activate that command. When a match is found, the command that defined the match is invoked in `processor` where the matching function is always passed the hubot response object and then any captured groups from the pattern in order they appeared in the pattern.\n\n## Contributing\nI'd like to think I'll get to add more stuff myself, but hey, it's free software and I have a lot of other stuff going on. So if you can JavaScript, <3 Destiny and want more features/fixes - quickest path to those is contributing.\n\nPlease be sure to add at least one test to cover any new commands. Even with that, I often screw up regex by making the matches too broad and hubot ends up trying to be helpful when you least expect.\n\n\n","maintainers":[{"name":"arobson","email":"asrobson@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-11-03T16:37:59.778Z","created":"2015-11-02T13:52:35.149Z","0.1.0":"2015-11-02T13:52:35.149Z","0.1.1":"2015-11-03T02:58:30.996Z","0.1.2":"2015-11-03T08:01:34.836Z","0.1.3":"2015-11-03T08:19:09.638Z","0.1.4":"2015-11-03T16:37:59.778Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/arobson/hubot-destined#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts","destiny"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/arobson/hubot-destined.git"},"author":{"name":"Alex Robson","email":"asrobson@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/arobson/hubot-destined/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
