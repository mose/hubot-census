This is a simple fork off of the popular hubot-plusplus hubot-script.\nThe changes made, although somewhat hacky, are in place to attempt to clean up\ngoofy scorings while running the script in Slack with a team. Changes are noted\nbelow.\n\nUser Validation Works like so, the bot will take the last word of a multi word \nmessage and check to see if it matches a username or is the prefix of a username.\nIf so, it will give the score to that username and drop the first part of the\nmessage. \n\nFor instance, the message `other words go here USERNAME++`, would give USERNAME\nan extra point. However, the message `other words++` would give `other words` an\nextra point unless a user is in the room that has `words` as part of their username.\n\nAll other commands work as designed in hubot-plusplus.\n\nOfficial Hubot-plusplus repo is located here: https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-plusplus\n\nAPI\n---\n\n* `thing++` - add a point to `thing`\n* `(misc message text) thing++` - add a point to `thing`\n* `++` - add a point to the most previously voted-on thing\n* `thing++ for stuff` - keep track of why you gave thing points\n* `thing--` - remove a point from `thing`\n* `--` - remove a point from the most previously voted-on thing\n* `thing-- for stuff` - keep track of why you removed thing points\n* `hubot erase thing` - erase thing from scoreboard (permanently deletes thing from memory)\n* `hubot erase thing for reason` erase given reason from thing's score board (does not deduct from total score)\n* `hubot top 10` - show the top 10, with a graph of points\n* `hubot score thing` - check the score for and reasons for `thing`\n\nUses Hubot brain. Also exposes the following events, should you wish to hook\ninto it to do things like print out funny gifs for point streaks:\n\n```coffeescript\nrobot.emit \"plus-one\", {\n  name: 'Jack'\n  direction: '++' # (or --)\n  room: 'chatRoomAlpha'\n  reason: 'being awesome'\n}\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nRun the following command \n\n    $ npm install hubot-plusplus-userverify\n\nThen to make sure the dependencies are installed:\n\n    $ npm install\n\nTo enable the script, add a `hubot-plusplus-userverify` entry to the `external-scripts.json`\nfile (you may need to create this file).\n\n    [\"hubot-plusplus-userverify\"]\n","maintainers":[{"name":"kwandrews7","email":"kwandrews7@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-03-20T21:09:47.255Z","created":"2015-03-20T21:09:47.255Z","1.0.0":"2015-03-20T21:09:47.255Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/kwandrews7/hubot-plusplus-userverify","keywords":["hubot","points","plus","karma","userverify"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/kwandrews7/hubot-plusplus-userverify.git"},"author":{"name":"Kyle Andrews","email":"https://github.com/kwandrews7"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kwandrews7/hubot-plusplus-userverify/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
